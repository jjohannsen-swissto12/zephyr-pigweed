# Sample project for Zephyr + Pigweed

## Environment

```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:google/pigweed.git third_party/pigweed
$ source third_party/pigweed/bootstrap.sh
$ pw package install zephyr
```

Pigweed provides a way to get both the Pigweed and Zephyr nodes for the West manifest. This is done
via a call to:

```shell
$ pw zephyr manifest
```

We can take output and place it into `manifest/west.yml` along with any other modules we'd like for
our application. At this point, we can also make changes to the fixed commit of Pigweed or the repo
of Zephyr (if we want to change away  from the default one used by Pigweed). This demo does switch
to the main Zephyr repo since some changes are in the release candidates of 3.6 and aren't yet in
the Pigweed fork. Once we're ready, we can run:

```shell
$ west init -l manifest
$ west update
```

Next, we want to use our project root directory as an entry point where we can have common code like
libraries, boards, and configurations. We will do this by adding a `module.yml` file inside a
`manifest/zephyr/` directory:

```yaml
build:
  # Path to the Kconfig file that will be sourced into Zephyr Kconfig tree under
  # Zephyr > Modules > {module_name}. Path is relative from where the west.yml
  # file is located.
  kconfig: ../Kconfig
  # Path to the folder that contains the CMakeLists.txt file to be included by
  # Zephyr build system. The `../` is the root of this repository.
  cmake: ../
```

## Application code

### The `hello_world` library
We're now ready for the application code. We'll start by creating a library under `lib/`. Normally, under Zephyr this
would look like:

```cmake
zephyr_library_named(hello_world)
zephyr_library_sources(include/hello.h src/hello.cc)
# Can't use zephyr_library_include_directories() because it makes the dirs PRIVATE
target_include_directories(hello_world PUBLIC include)
# Can't use zephyr_library_link_libraries() because it makes the libraries PRIVATE
target_link_libraries(hello_world PUBLIC pw_string)
```

Instead, we're able to leverage Pigweed's build tooling and create:

```cmake
include($ENV{PW_ROOT}/pw_build/pigweed.cmake)

pw_add_library(hello_world STATIC
  HEADERS
    include/hello.h
  SOURCES
    src/hello.cc
  PUBLIC_INCLUDES
    include
  PUBLIC_DEPS
    pw_string
    zephyr_interface
)
```

### The application
For our main application we'll allocate a `pw::StringBuffer`, generate a welcome message, then log it via
`PW_LOG_INFO()`. All this can be found in `app/src/main.cc`. The primary CMake file here sets up the project,
adds the sources, and links the `hello_world` library we created.

We can run this application via:
```shell
$ west build -p -b native_sim -t run app/
```

## Adding tests
Side by side with the code, we're going to add a `test_hello.cc` which will get compiled via the CMake function
`pw_add_test()` and linked into `app` by adding `hello_world.test.lib` as a dependency. The test uses gTest APIs
to verify the behavior of `app::WelcomeMessage()`.

### Run the test
```shell
$ west twister -cvi -T app/
```

At this point the test should pass, but if you look closely at the implementation, it's clearly
flawed. We'll fix it later in the Embedded C++101 section below.

## Testing on more targets
Zephyr comes with several QEMU targets. To run our tests against them, we don't need to change anything except for
adding the new targets to the `testcase.yaml` file:

```yaml
platform_allow:
  - qemu_riscv64
  - qemu_cortex_a53
```

We can now run the tests again via the same `west twister ...` command as before and see the new runs.

# Embedded C++101

## Overview of String libraries
This exercise demonstrates the use of some of Pigweed's utilities for string manipulation. We've already seen a preview
of this via the `pw::StringBuilder` and `pw::InlineString` classes.

> See https://pigweed.dev/pw_string/ for reference.

### Using `std::string_view`
If your function doesn't need to modify or store the content of the string, it should accept
`std::string_view` (passed by value). This approach is better than using `std::string` or
`const std::string&` as it avoids copying the data. It is effectively the same as passing a safe
version of `(const char *str, size_t size)`. It is important to note that `std::string_view` is not
inherently NULL terminated.

### Exercise

#### Using `std::string_view`
Edit `hello.h` to accept `std::string_view` for both the `greeting` and the `name` rather than
`const pw::InlineString<>&` and update `hello.cc` to match. Confirm that your tests still pass.

### Extending tests
Add more tests to verify that the greeting has both `greeting` and `name`.

## Hash Tables
Looking up values in an index is one of the primary use cases for hash containers (associative
containers). The hashed values are used as the keys in hash tables, allowing you to retrieve the
value using the key as an O(1) operation.

Embedded solutions for O(1) lookup don't currently exist, but we can get close with
[pw::containers::FlatMap](https://pigweed.dev/pw_containers/#pw-containers-flatmap) which gives us
O(log _n_) lookup. The one catch is that all the keys have to be inserted into the map at compile
time.

> New `BUILD` dependencies: `pw_containers`

> NOTE: For this exercise we're going to also use `pw::Status` and `pw::Result`. These come from the
> CMake libraries `pw_status` and `pw_result` respectively.

### Exercise
This exercise demonstrates how to utilize Pigweed's `FlatMap`.

#### Developing our Track database
We've added a new `struct Track` and `class TrackDatabase` to `hello.h`. Using an appropriate hash
table, add appropriate private member(s) as needed to your `TrackDatabase` to hold your set of
`Track*` references.

For testing, a static function was added (`app::CannedTracks()`). You may wish to use this function
to provide some canned track data for testing.

### Extending Tests
Add some tests for various behaviors:

* Add a test that an empty `TrackDatabase` behaves as expected.
* Add a test that a `TrackDatabase` that's initialized with data holds those tracks

## Filtered Views
Having a map is great, but is there a convenient way to search? `pw::container::FilteredView` gives
us a low-cost solution by using iterators and a predicate. We're going to add a few new types to
our `TrackDatabase` in order to keep things simple and add a new function signature which will
return a constant `FilteredView` of the map. We can then use the view to iterate through entries
which match our search criteria.

> NOTE: While `std::function` isn't great for embedded application, using `pw::Function` from the
> `pw_function` library gives us a single capture value lambda support that works great in the
> embedded space.

### Exercise
We've added a new function to our `TrackDatabase` with the following signature below. Implement it
to return the `FilterView` that returns all entries containing `name` as a substring.

```c++
pw::container::FilteredView<map_type, filter_type> FindTracksByName(
    std::string_view name) const;
```

### Extending Tests
Add some tests for the various behaviors:

* Searching for a substring that doesn't exist, returns an empty set
* Searching for a substring that has exactly 1 match, returns a set with just 1 entry
* Searching for a substring with multiple matches, returns a set with ALL the entries

## WrappedIterator
You might have noticed our filter returns both the value and key to the map, that's likely not what
we wanted. Instead, we just want to be able to iterate through the values. We can use
`pw::container:WrappedIterator` for that. The `WrappedIterator` takes an iterator type and uses both
the `*` and `->` operators to convert each value type.

### Exercise
1. We've added a `ValueIterator` class to our `TrackDatabase`. It is your goal to implement the `*`
   operator such that we return a reference to a `Track` object instead of the `Pair`.
2. We've provided a `WrapFilteredView` function. You'll need to implement it such that it returns
   the instance of the `ValueIterator` wrapping the `FilteredView` iterator.

### Extending Tests
Update our tests to use the wrapped iterator and verify each `Track` without using `Pair::second`.

# Testing with Renode

A separate document in this repository, [RENODE.md](RENODE.md), contains a tutorial on Renode usage with the Zephyr+Pigweed setup.
